# Dynamo AI: Inclusive Multi-Lingual AI-Based Chatbot for Enterprises

## Overview

Dynamo AI is an inclusive, multi-lingual AI-powered chatbot designed specifically for enterprises to enhance organizational efficiency. Built with advanced technologies, this platform uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** on top of **LLAMA 3.1** to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.

This solution is designed to boost productivity, improve decision-making, and ensure data security, all while offering an engaging and personalized user experience.

## Features

- **Multi-lingual Support**: The chatbot supports multiple languages for both input and output (text and audio), ensuring accessibility and inclusiveness across diverse user groups.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system implements **Role-Based Access to Content**, allowing fine-grained control over document access. Only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Integrated 2FA via **Gmail SMTP** to enhance login security, supporting multiple users simultaneously.
- **Offensive Language Detection**: Utilizes **Contextual Transformers** to detect and prevent the use of offensive language, maintaining a respectful environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app offers an intuitive user interface, simplifying document upload, query interactions, and ensuring seamless access for multiple users.
- **Open-Source Technology**: Built entirely with open-source software, Dynamo AI is easy to deploy, cost-effective, and easily customizable for enterprise needs.
